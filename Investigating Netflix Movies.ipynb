    "Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been supplied with the dataset netflix_data.csv , along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions:\n",

    "The data\n",

    "Column\tDescription\n",
    "show_id\tThe ID of the show\n",

    "title\tTitle of the show\n",
    "director\tDirector of the show\n",
    "cast\tCast of the show\n",
    "country\tCountry of origin\n",
    "date_added\tDate added to Netflix\n",

    "Your friend suspects that movies are getting shorter and they've found some initial evidence of this. Having peaked your interest, you will perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand what may be contributing to movies getting shorter over time. Your analysis will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the CSV file and store as netflix_df.\n",
    "Filter the data to remove TV shows and store as netflix_subset.\n",
    "Investigate the Netflix movie data, keeping only the columns \"title\", \"country\", \"genre\", \"release_year\", \"duration\", and saving this into a new DataFrame called netflix_movies.\n",
    "Filter netflix_movies to find the movies that are shorter than 60 minutes, saving the resulting DataFrame as short_movies; inspect the result to find possible contributing factors.\n",
    "Using a for loop and if/elif statements, iterate through the rows of netflix_movies and assign colors of your choice to four genre groups (\"Children\", \"Documentaries\", \"Stand-Up\", and \"Other\" for everything else). Save the results in a colors list. Initialize a figure object called fig and create a scatter plot for movie duration by release year using the colors list to color the points and using the labels \"Release year\" for the x-axis, \"Duration (min)\" for the y-axis, and the title \"Movie Duration by Year of Release\".\n",
    "After inspecting the plot, answer the question \"Are we certain that movies are getting shorter?\" by assigning either \"yes\", \"no\", or \"maybe\" to the variable answer.\n",
